Covfee is a web application within a Python package, much like Jupyter notebooks. Covfee runs on **Linux, Mac OS X and Windows**, but you are more likely to encounter bugs on Windows.

### Prerequisites

The only prerequisites for installing Covfee locally are Python 3 and Node.js:

- [Python 3 (>= 3.6)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Make sure that the `npm` command is available in your terminal.

### Setup

We recommend that you work with Covfee locally first even if you plan to put it online. Install Covfee locally as a Python package:

1. Create and activate a virtual environment for Covfee, using eg. virtualenv or conda. We do not recommend that you install Covfee globally.

2. Install via:

```
python -m pip install covfee
```

For a development setup, recommended if you want to program your own covfee tasks, please see [Development Install](development)
