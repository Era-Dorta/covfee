title: Developing custom tasks
---


New custom tasks or HIT types can be added by implementing a React component meeting a few conditions. For some tasks, a Python base class must be sub-classed too. To be valid, task components must meet these conditions:

## Types of tasks
There are two main types of tasks in covfee:

- Tasks with shared state, or "multiplayer" tasks are meant to be visited by multiple users at the same time. A chess game, or a collaborative live view form to be filled by multiple users at the same time is an example of a shared state task. Covfee internally manages state synchronization and persistence. A copy of the latest state is kept in the server.
- Tasks without shared state, or "single player" tasks are meant to be visited by a single user. A standard form is a good example.

## Task state

Covfee tasks are, in their most basic form, simply React components. In other words, copy-pasting any React component as a Covfee task would "work". However, any type of online experiment we normally want to store the results of the task (eg. the answers to a questionnaire). 

In covfee, task components do not explicitly store or commit these results to the server. Instead, the state of the task can be saved automatically by covfee. To make use of this, any task state that should be persisted by Covfee must be managed in a central Redux store. In other words, **implementing Covfee tasks boils down to implementing React components with a Redux store** in all cases. State that does not need to be stored can be managed separately, for example using React's `useState`.

State persistance and loading will be managed internally:
- For shared state tasks, Covfee will keep the most up-to-date state in the server, which will always represent the latest state of the task.

- For non-shared state tasks, the latest state is kept in the browser and persisted when necessary. Covfee submits and persists state whenever:
    - A user closes the browser tab where the task is open, or otherwise leaves the task.
    - A user presses the "submit" button in the task.

## Tutorial: developing your own task

### Background
For developing custom tasks it is important to be familiar with:
- React: functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useRef, useMemo), custom hooks, fetching data
- Redux, Redux toolkit
- Typescript, Javascript, HTML, CSS

In general, **you should know how to write a React functional component using Redux for state management**.

Please start by following the [development install instructions](development).

In this tutorial, we will create a simple contact form asking users for their name and email. Additionally, the task will have one boolean prop (`showPhoneField`) that, if true, will add a phone number field to the form. The answers to the form will be preserved in task state. 

We will place Typescript files for the task in `covfee/client/tasks`, in the following structure:

```
covfee
    client
        tasks
            - my_task
                - index.tsx       # the main React component
                - slice.ts        # the state specification
                - spec.ts         # the props for the task
                ...               # any extra files needed
```

### Task props

First, we place the specification for the task props in the `spec.ts` file:

```
import { BaseTaskSpec } from "@covfee-shared/spec/task"

/**
 * @TJS-additionalProperties false
 */
export interface TutorialTaskSpec extends BaseTaskSpec {
  /**
   * @default "TutorialTask"
   */
  type: "TutorialTask"
  /**
   * Media file to be displayed.
   */
  showPhoneField?: boolean
}
```

These props will be parsed by covfee so that they can be provided when the task is created. They allow the user to configure the way a task is rendered to the user. In this case, we only provide two props. One is the name of the task. This will be the name of the task's Python class and is a constant value. The other one is our only true prop `showPhoneField`, which we define to be boolean. The comments provided here will be parsed and will be available in Python when creating task objects. The line `TJS-additionalProperties false` specifies that no additional properties should be allowed when the task is validated.

### State

Tasks in covfee specify their state by creating a Redux Toolkit slice. For our purposes a slice is just an object that encapsulates the initial state and the reducers for the task. In this case, we need the state to hold the user's name and email:

```
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"

export interface State {
  name: string
  email: string
}

export const initialState: State = {
  name: "",
  email: "",
}

export const slice = createSlice({
  name: "form",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    setName: (state, action) => {
      state.name = action.payload
    },
    setPhoneNumber: (state, action) => {
      state.email = action.payload
    },
  },
})

export const { actions, reducer } = slice
```

### React Component

```
import React, { useState } from "react"
import { slice, actions } from "./slice"
import { TaskExport } from "../../types/node"
import { CovfeeTaskProps } from "../base"
import type { TutorialTaskSpec } from "./spec"
import { AllPropsRequired } from "../../types/utils"

interface Props extends CovfeeTaskProps<TutorialTaskSpec> {}

const TutorialTask: React.FC<Props> = (props) => {
  const args: AllPropsRequired<Props> = {
    ...props,
    spec: {
      ...props.spec,
      showPhoneField: true,
    },
  }

  return (
    <form>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="name">Name:</label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="name"
          onChange={(e) => actions.setName(e.target.value)}
          required
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="email">Email:</label>
        <input
          type="email"
          id="email"
          onChange={(e) => actions.setEmail(e.target.value)}
          required
        />
      </div>
      {args.spec.showPhoneField && (
        <div>
          <label htmlFor="phone">Phone:</label>
          <input
            type="tel"
            id="phone"
            onChange={(e) => actions.setPhone(e.target.value)}
          />
        </div>
      )}
    </form>
  )
}
export type { TutorialTaskSpec }
export default {
  taskComponent: TutorialTask,
  taskSlice: slice,
  useSharedState: false,
} as TaskExport

```

Here we are simply updating the state whenever the input elements change. That's all!

Note the export statements at the end of the file. First we export the task specification, which should be available to Covfee (more on this later)

Covfee expects every task to export a default object with these keys. `useSharedState` should only be set to true for "multiplayer" tasks.


### Importing the task
Now that the task is created, the task should be imported into Covfee source files. To do this, modify the file at `/covfee/client/tasks/index.ts` to import your custom task. Simply follow the same pattern as for the rest of the imports in the file. The task props specification (*spec*) should also be imported in `/covfee/shared/spec/task.ts`.


Now we are ready to create the auto-generated code that Covfee is designed to create. Covfee auto-generates two files using the tasks' props specification:

- /covfee/shared/schemata.json - JSON schemata. Each task props specification (spec) is translated into a JSON schema, used for validation and for generating the dataclasses.
- /covfee/shared/task_dataclasses.py contains the dataclasses that can be used to create task objects in Python. These are simple objects that take the task props as constructor arguments. Covfee internally translates them into database entries to initialize its database on startup.

These files may be useful for debugging purposes to eg. make sure that the dataclasses have the right arguments, types and comments.

To (re-)create both of these auto-generated files run:

```
covfee-dev schemata
```

After this step, it should be possible to manually verify that the dataclasses file contains a new class for our custom task.

<!--
The task also needs to be included in the 
```
covfee-dev build        
```
-->




## Running the task

The task is ready to be used. To do this in a dev environment, create a folder for the covfee project. This folder may be anywhere in the file system. The we will create the following structure:

```
my_folder
    - tutorial.py
```

The naming is not relevant. Paste the following into the `tutorial.py`:

```
from covfee import tasks, HIT, Project
from covfee.config import config
from covfee.shared.dataclass import CovfeeApp

config.load_environment("local")

my_task_1 = tasks.TutorialTaskSpec(name="My Task 1", showPhoneField=True)
my_task_2 = tasks.TutorialTaskSpec(name="My Task 2", showPhoneField=False)

hit = HIT("Joint counter")
j1 = hit.add_journey(nodes=[my_task_1, my_task_2])

projects = [Project("My Project", email="example@example.com", hits=[hit])]
app = CovfeeApp(projects)   # we must always create an app object of class CovfeeApp
```

Here we import the necessary classes, create two task objects using the same (auto-generated) `TutorialTaskSpec` class, and link them together in a journey. We create a HIT with a single journey, and a project with a single HIT. Finally, we create the `app` object. Covfee internally looks for this object by name (important that it is called `app`) and uses it as starting point to read the specification.

We can now start covfee with:

```
covfee make tutorial.py --force --dev
```

This will parse the specification, create the database, and start the covfee server.

In development mode, we need to run the webpack server separately. To do it, in another terminal run:
```
covfee webpack
```

After this the Covfee admin panel should be accessible in the URL displayed when running the Covfee server (http://localhost:5000/admin# by default). The links to the Journey (with the two tasks) should be available in the admin panel (under *Journeys*).

With this development setup, any changes to the client or server will be hot-reloaded. Therefore it should be possible and convenient to edit the task's React component or the backend while running the app.

## Adding server-side code

Tasks that have specific data transfer requirements (eg. annotation tasks) may need to implement custom API endpoints.
