import { Typography, Space } from 'antd'

The instructions task was created as a way to provide a page with instructions for participants or annotators. This also includes consent forms and *Thank you* pages. An instructions tasks consists in a text document followed by an optional form, which can be used to request consent or ask for basic participant information.

# Basic

The easiest way to provide instructions is to pass Markdown code directly to the `InstructionsTask`. Note however that this is only recommended for short instructions. The reason is that JSON does not preserve line breaks, and therefore any linebreaks must be explicitly input with <Typography.Text code>\\n</Typography.Text>:

export const uiSchema = {
    'ui:order': ['name', 'type', 'content', 'form'],
    type: {'ui:widget':'hidden'},
    content: {
        type: {'ui:widget':'hidden'},
        content: {'ui:widget': 'textarea'}
    }
}

export const taskSpec = {
    "name": "Instructions",
    "type": "InstructionsTask",
    "content": {
        "type": "raw",
        "content": "# Instructions\n\nThese are the instructions provided directly in Markdown.\n\n**We recommend that you use this mode for instructions that you can write using this interactive form. If you prefer to write the instructions in a separate markdown file, see below for how to link to your own Markdown file.**"
    }
}

<TaskForm spec={taskSpec} 
    schemaName='InstructionsTaskSpec'
    uiSchema={uiSchema}
    formEnabled={false}/>

# Link to Markdown file

You can also link to a Markdown file with experiment or annotation instructions. This is the best way to write instructions that are longer than a few sentences. Markdown also supports HTML tags.

export const taskSpecMd = {
    "name": "Instructions",
    "type": "InstructionsTask",
    "content": {
        "type": "link",
        "url": "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benbalter/3914310/raw/f757a33411082da23f0ad4a124b45fcdacc1b43f/Example--text.txt"
    }
}

<TaskForm spec={taskSpecMd} 
    schemaName='InstructionsTaskSpec'
    uiSchema={uiSchema}
    formEnabled={false}/>
