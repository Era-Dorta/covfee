## Inline text

The easiest way to provide instructions is to pass Markdown code directly to the `InstructionsTask`. Note however that this is only recommended for short instructions. The reason is that JSON does not preserve line breaks, and therefore any linebreaks must be explicitly input with <Typography.Text code>\\n</Typography.Text>:

export const playgroundTasks = [
    {
        'schema': 'InstructionsTaskSpec',
        'label': 'Basic instructions',
        'spec': {
            "name": "Instructions",
            "type": "InstructionsTask",
            "content": {
                "type": "raw",
                "content": "# Instructions\n\nThese are the instructions provided directly in Markdown.\n\n**We recommend that you use this mode for instructions that you can write using this interactive form. If you prefer to write the instructions in a separate markdown file, see below for how to link to your own Markdown file.**"
            },
            "form": {
                "fields": [
                    {
                        "name": "name",
                        "label": "Full name:",
                        "required": true,
                        "input": {
                            "inputType": "Input"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "agreement",
                        "label": "To proceed, you must expressly agree to the provided instructions.",
                        "required": true,
                        "input": {
                            "inputType": "Checkbox.Group",
                            "options": [
                                {"label": "I agree with the provided instructions.", "value": "yes"}
                            ]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
]

## Link to Markdown

You can also link to a Markdown file with experiment or annotation instructions. This is the best way to write instructions that are longer than a few sentences. Markdown also supports HTML tags.

export const playgroundTasks2 = [
    {
        'schema': 'InstructionsTaskSpec',
        'label': 'Link to Markdown',
        'spec': {
            "name": "Instructions",
            "type": "InstructionsTask",
            "content": {
                "type": "link",
                "url": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/josedvq/covfee@nonseq-buffer/samples/basic/www/consent.md"
            },
            "form": {
                "fields": [
                    {
                        "name": "agree",
                        "label": "I agree with the provided instructions.",
                        "input": {
                            "inputType": "Checkbox"
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
]
