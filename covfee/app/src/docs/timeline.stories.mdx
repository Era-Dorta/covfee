# Timeline HITs

HITs with a `type` of `timeline` are rendered as a series of tasks that must be completed in order. An array of tasks, of possibly different types must be specified in order. Users cannot add tasks to timeline HITs (the `interface.userTasks` property of annotation HITs is ignored).

export const hitSpec = {
    "type": "timeline",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "type": "InstructionsTask",
            "html": "Please watch each video and answer the questions next to it."
        },
        {
            "type": "QuestionnaireTask",
            "form": {
                "fields": [
                    {
                        "prompt": "Does the person in the video laugh?",
                        "input": {
                            "type": "radio",
                            "options": [
                            "yes",
                            "no"
                            ]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            },
