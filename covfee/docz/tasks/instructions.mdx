# Instructions Task

This component displays experiment instructions, but it can be used in general for static content. Content can be fed directly or via a public URL to a Markdown document, which will be loaded and displayed by the component.

<Props of={InstructionsTask}/>

## Direct content

Pass valid Markdown directly to the component. While this is easy, it can be inconvenient because it requires newlines (\\n) to be typed in manually.
<Playground>
    <InstructionsTask {...{html: "# Instructions\nPlease watch the following videos and answer the questionnaire after each one."}}/>
</Playground>


## File link

Pass a link to a Markdown file, which can also contain HTML.

<Playground>
    <InstructionsTask {...{url: "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benbalter/3914310/raw/f757a33411082da23f0ad4a124b45fcdacc1b43f/example-md.md"}}/>
