# Basic

The easiest way to provide instructions is to pass HTML code directly to the `Instructions` task:

export const taskSpec = {
    "type": "InstructionsTask",
    "html": "<h1>Instructions</h1><p>These are the instructions provided directly in HTML.</p><p>This is good for short instructions but inconvenient for long ones because you cannot have line breaks in a JSON file. Linking to a Markdown file is more convenient in that case.</p>"
}

<TaskVisualizer task={taskSpec}/>

# Link to Markdown file

You can also link to a Markdown file with experiment or annotation instructions. This is the best way to write instructions that are longer than a few sentences. Markdown also supports HTML tags.

export const taskSpecMd = {
    "type": "InstructionsTask",
    "url": "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benbalter/3914310/raw/f757a33411082da23f0ad4a124b45fcdacc1b43f/Example--text.txt"
}

<TaskVisualizer task={taskSpecMd}/>

<ArgsTable of={InstructionsTask}/>
