<Meta title="Tasks / Instructions" component={InstructionsTask} />

The instructions task was created as a way to provide a page with instructions for participants or annotators. 

# Basic

The easiest way to provide instructions is to pass HTML code directly to the `Instructions`. Note however that this is obly recommended for short instructions. The reason is that JSON does not preserve line breaks, and therefore any linebreaks must be explicitly input with <Typography.Text code>\\n</Typography.Text>:

export const taskSpec = {
    "type": "InstructionsTask",
    "html": "<h1>Instructions</h1><p>These are the instructions provided directly in HTML.</p><p>This is good for short instructions but inconvenient for long ones because you cannot have line breaks in a JSON file. Linking to a Markdown file is more convenient in that case.</p>"
}

<TaskForm spec={taskSpec} 
    schema={schemata['definitions']['InstructionsTaskSpec']}
    formEnabled={false}/>

# Link to Markdown file

You can also link to a Markdown file with experiment or annotation instructions. This is the best way to write instructions that are longer than a few sentences. Markdown also supports HTML tags.

export const taskSpecMd = {
    "type": "InstructionsTask",
    "url": "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benbalter/3914310/raw/f757a33411082da23f0ad4a124b45fcdacc1b43f/Example--text.txt"
}

<TaskForm spec={taskSpecMd} 
    schema={schemata['definitions']['InstructionsTaskSpec']}
    formEnabled={false}/>
